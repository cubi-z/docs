# Projected APR

To understand the difference between distributed and pending yield, see the [yield earning](vaults-1.md#yield-earning) section.

### Distribution APR

This is the APR the vault is distributing right now.

This is the current yield you're getting on your deposit in the vault. This yield is based on the latest harvested amount that's currently being distributed.

### Projected APR

This is the APR the vault is earning now but it's not yet distributed.

This is the projected future yield that is currently being earned by the vault across all the lending pairs but has not yet been harvested or distributed.
