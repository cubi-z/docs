# Current vs Projected APR

To understand the difference between distributed and pending yield, see the [yield earning](vaults-1.md#yield-earning) section.

### Current APR

This is what you're earning **right now**.

This is the current yield you're getting on your deposit in the vault. This yield is based on the latest harvested amount that's currently being distributed.

### Projected APR

This is what you might be earning **in the future**.

This is the projected future yield that is currently being earned by the vault across all the lending pairs but has not yet been harvested or distributed.
